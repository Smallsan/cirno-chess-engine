# Cirno Chess Engine
A programmer's first attempt at a full from scratch chess engine.

A "Two Leaf Lotus" project.

### Credits
- Sebastian Lague for getting me into the world of chess programming.
- Small for fixing castling, behaviour with attacked squares, pinned pieces, and more funky bugs.

### The Moment where it all started
